## Description

This project required us to come up with an idea for a interactive front-end application web application leveraging HTML, CSS, Tailwind as a CSS framework, Javascript and JQuery. The external APIs that we used for our Movie Search Application were Youtube and OMBD. The application allows the user to search for movies, when they do they are presented with a list of options to select from based on key word search. When they select from this list, the site shares key Youtube Trailers for the film, as well as surfaces movie data from OMDB including the poster, awards, IMDB rating, Genres and Key Actors. The purpose is that the user should have enough informaiton to decide if this is a film they want to watch. Previous searches are saved to local storage, duplicates are removed and only 7 search are displayed to the user.
